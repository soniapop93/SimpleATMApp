# SimpleATMApp

This simple project will essentially create a simulation of an ATM that takes the input from user.
    

## What the script does

    -> Checking whether an input â€“ such as an ATM card (a debit/credit card number) â€“ is recorded correctly
    -> Verifying the user by asking for a PIN
    -> Save the PIN in DB as SHA256
    -> In case of negative verification, logging out the user
    -> In case of positive verification, showing multiple options, including cash availability, the previous transactions, cash withdrawal, personal information
    -> Giving the user the ability to withdraw up to $1,000 worth of cash in one transaction, with total transactions limited to ten per day.
